Analysis of wine samples using R
====================================
This is an exploratory analysis of a dataset of wine samples. I have started off with a dataset of 1599 red wine samples, tried to look at this data from different viewpoints and tried to find patterns in this data. In this process, I have created many rapid prototypes using the ggplot package in R. 
After having completed the exploratory analysis of the data, I have tried to predict the quality of the wine samples using the ingredients that go into making of a wine. I have played around with different machine learning algorithms and features in my dataset to compare the accuracy obtained from these combinations.
